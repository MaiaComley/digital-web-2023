      <h3 class="homepage-titles homepage-titles-wrap fade-in"> Amy’s Backstory & her key moments </h3>
      <p class="homepage-text fade-in">
        Born on September 14th, 1983, in Southgate, London, Amy Jade Winehouse entered the world. Raised in a Jewish household, her father, Mitch Winehouse, drove taxis, while her mother, Janis Winehouse, worked as a pharmacist.

        Reflecting on Amy's childhood reveals a spirited young girl. Nicknamed "Nudge" for her constant pushing of boundaries, Amy enjoyed people saying no to he because of the reaction it provoked. Her grandmother played a significant role in instilling discipline, earning Amy's respect and serving as a source of strength for her and her brother, Alex.
      </p>

      <p class="homepage-text fade-in">
        From a young age Amy was exposed to music and showcased a talent for singing. Artists like Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington and Thelonious Monk played a significant role in shaping her musical tastes. Amy’s nan was semi-professional singer, through her musical career she made a connection with the saxophonist Ronnie Scott, who founded his jazz club in Soho London. She attended a Theatre School in London and had formal training for performing arts, soon after in her teens she began to perform live at local jazz clubs. Her distinctive, soulful voice was recognised by multiple record labels.

      <p class="homepage-text fade-in">
         In 2003, Amy unveiled her debut album, "Frank," marking the inception of her illustrious career. However, it was her second album, "Back to Black," produced by Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi, that propelled her to stardom. With its retro soul sound and poignant lyrics reflecting Amy's personal battles, the album resonated deeply with audiences. Its success culminated in Amy winning a Grammy in 2006, with "Rehab" earning accolades for Best Song and Best Recording.

        Despite Amy's remarkable presence in the industry, she grappled with personal demons. Struggling with drug and alcohol addiction, her battles with substance abuse became fodder for tabloid headlines, overshadowing her musical accomplishments. Sadly, her story mirrored a common narrative in the music industry, where artists can become ensnared in its toxic culture, losing themselves in the process. Tragically, Amy passed away in July 2011 at the tender age of 27. Her emotive songwriting and extraordinary voice left an indelible mark on the industry. Her untimely death sparked conversations about the pressures of fame and the critical importance of mental health awareness in the industry.

      <p class="homepage-text fade-in">
        Amy's journey in both life and career was defined by moments of triumph and adversity, yet she endures as one of the most gifted and impactful artists of her era. We honour her talent and legacy by perpetuating her music. Recognized as a profound artist of her generation, Amy Winehouse's 31st birthday was commemorated with a sculpture unveiled at the Stables Market in Camden. On September 14th, 2014, her enduring spirit was immortalized with the unveiling of a life-sized bronze statue, a fitting tribute to her passionate and inspiring life.
