          <h1>about me & my design inspiration  </h1>
          <p>
            Amy Winehouse served as the focal point of my media production, particularly centred on the 2015 documentary film "Amy". From the outset, I was drawn to her for my website, as her profound impact on the industry epitomized boldness and creativity. As a musician, she evolved into an icon, captivating audiences with her awe-inspiring songs. Through my website, I aimed to showcase her remarkable personality and talent. By integrating storytelling and interactivity, users can delve into her life and legacy. A sleek, minimalist website design featuring a flat, white backdrop guides visitors through my areas of emphasis. I opted for the colour red to centre my theme, as it symbolizes power, love, and ambition, resonating deeply with her persona. This striking hue adds presence and a personal touch, contrasting with the minimalism of black and white. Through my illustrations, I establish a visual connection between the elements and Amy, accentuating her significance.

            My goal in creating my website was to push my creative boundaries and showcase it through my personal expression and design choices. The selection of Amy Winehouse aligns with my artistic expression due to her embodiment of a style I admire, characterized by boldness and authenticity. I enjoy graphic prints and illustrations, particularly those influenced by pop art. The contrast and expressive nature in this design style captivates me, conveying a bold and attention-grabbing essence. During my studies of Andy Warhol in sixth form college, his artistic expression has stayed with me. As a leader of the pop art movement, he sparked a wave of vibrant colours and bold contrasts. Colour played a significant role in his work, influencing my own considerations of colour in later projects and its capacity to convey themes and emotions.
