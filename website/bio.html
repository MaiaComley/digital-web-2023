            Amy Winehouse was the focal point of my media production, mainly centred on the 2015 documentary "Amy". From the outset, I was drawn to her for my website, as her profound impact on the industry epitomized boldness and creativity. As a musician, she became an icon, captivating audiences with her awe-inspiring songs. Through my website, I aimed to showcase her remarkable personality and talent. Users can delve into her life and legacy by integrating storytelling and interactivity. A sleek, minimalist website design featuring a flat, white backdrop guides visitors through my areas of emphasis. I chose red to centre my theme, as it symbolizes power, love, and ambition, resonating deeply with her persona. This striking hue adds presence and a personal touch, contrasting with the minimalism of black and white. I establish a visual connection between the elements and Amy through my illustrations, accentuating her significance.</p>

            My goal in creating my website was to push my creative boundaries and showcase it through my personal expression and design choices. The selection of Amy Winehouse aligns with my artistic expression due to her embodiment of a style I admire, characterized by boldness and authenticity. I enjoy graphic prints and illustrations, particularly those influenced by pop art. This design style's contrast and expressive nature captivate me, conveying a bold and attention-grabbing essence. During my studies of Andy Warhol in sixth form college, his artistic expression has stayed with me. As a leader of the pop art movement, he sparked a wave of vibrant colours and bold contrasts. Colour played a significant role in his work, influencing my considerations of colour in later projects and its capacity to convey themes and emotions. </p>

            Positionality emerges as a significant factor when considering my assignment and the preliminary research I conducted. Informed by my interests and further exploration, it becomes challenging to disentangle the social dynamics and external influences shaping my research. <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1268044.pdf" id="bio-link"> As Holmes (2020)</a> notes, positionality is intricately tied to the researcher's social, historical, and political context, invariably shaping their perspectives. In the society I am positioned in, it is difficult to ‘escape the social world’ inevitably introducing bias into the research process. I agree with this study, recognising that our surroundings and predispositions influence our choices. In my case, Amy Winehouse has been an interest of mine for years, leading me to spotlight her story through my website and cast a positive light on her legacy. However, another individual might focus on the positionalities surrounding issues like drug abuse, shedding light on the darker aspects of the music industry, for instance. </p>
